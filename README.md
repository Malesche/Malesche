### Hi, I'm Maria.

I studied theoretical computer science and am now getting into databases and backend stuff.

There is a lot I want to learn!

most immediately
- learn and practice ASP.NET Core Web API
- learn and practice ASP.NET Core MVC
- learn more C#
- learn more .NET fundamentals

own projects
- Tender Buttons API, returning bits of poetry
- get around to cleaning up/ extending BookLog Database from my course exercise
- extend to a book organizing system, organizing lists, hopefully integrating tags/genres from library/goodreads?

also:
- deeper understanding of Relational Databases and SQL.
  - The two part course [Advanced SQL: Logical Query Processing](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/advanced-sql-logical-query-processing-part-1/) looks really helpful and approachable 
- NoSQL Databases
- cloud stuff
- more Docker, Git

What I want to learn and understand better longer term (at the moment I can't properly grasp that much of it yet):
- Database Internals - Book by Alex Petrov
- Designing Data-Intensive Applications - Book by Martin Kleppmann
- [Fundamentals of Database Engineering](https://www.udemy.com/course/database-engines-crash-course/) - Course by Hussein Nasser

For anyone interested in in depth looks at Backend and in particular Database issues, I highly recommend checking out Hussein Nasser's content:

I'm a bit obsessed with books and library catalogues. From classics, modernist literature, Science Fiction, popular science, psychology, sociology, memoir, selfhelp to literery fiction and contemporary poetry.

Some of my favorite Authors are Anne Carson, Maggie Nelson, Tommy Pico, Monika Helfer, Sheila Heti, Alejandro Zambra, Simone de Beauvoir, George Eliot, Clarice Lispector, Gertrude Stein, Virginia Woolf, Ted Chiang, Carlo Rovelli, Peter Levine.
