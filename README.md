### Hi, I'm Maria.

I studied theoretical computer science and am now getting into databases and backend stuff.

There is a lot I want to learn!

most immediately
- learn and practice ASP.NET Core Web API
- learn and practice ASP.NET Core MVC
- learn more C#
- learn more .NET fundamentals

own projects
- Tender Buttons API, returning bits of poetry
- get around to cleaning up/ extending BookLog Database from my course exercise
- extend to a book organizing system, organizing lists, hopefully integrating tags/genres from library/goodreads?

also:
- deeper understanding of Relational Databases and SQL.
  - The two part course [Advanced SQL: Logical Query Processing](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/advanced-sql-logical-query-processing-part-1/) looks really helpful and approachable 
- NoSQL Databases
- cloud stuff
- more Docker, Git

What I want to learn and understand better longer term (at the moment I can't properly grasp that much of it yet):
- Database Internals - Book by Alex Petrov
- Designing Data-Intensive Applications - Book by Martin Kleppmann
- [Fundamentals of Database Engineering](https://www.udemy.com/course/database-engines-crash-course/) - Course by Hussein Nasser

For anyone interested in in depth looks at Backend and in particular Database issues, I highly recommend checking out Hussein Nasser's content:
