### Hi, I'm Maria.

I am a computer scientist and an artist.
In my artistic practice as well as in my work in formal logic and programming, I love moving through our human systems of action and interaction, following the necessities of problems to be tackled and the logic of the languages we use to build things. We build complex, many-layered systems and within them pursue functionality and consistency.

After studying painting for three years, I studied and graduated in computer science. I specialized in logic and in particular in descriptive complexity theory, which analyses the surprising connections between complexity classes and formal logics. Although I am very fond of abstract theory, I decided against the academic world and after a break of several years, I have now returned to the practical side of computer science.

Lately, I focused on C#, .NET and database technologies. One of my favorite aspects of software development is the chance to work together in a team! I also particularly enjoy working with the structured approaches to the organization of collaboration, projects and code, such as agile methods and clean code practices.

Apart from computer science and textile art I love books, libraries and spending time outdoors!

<!--There is a lot I want to learn!

most immediately
- learn and practice ASP.NET Core Web API
- learn and practice ASP.NET Core MVC
- learn more C#
- learn more .NET fundamentals

own projects
- Tender Buttons API, returning bits of poetry
- get around to cleaning up/ extending BookLog Database from my course exercise
- extend to a book organizing system, organizing lists, hopefully integrating tags/genres from library/goodreads?

also:
- deeper understanding of Relational Databases and SQL.
  - The two part course [Advanced SQL: Logical Query Processing](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/advanced-sql-logical-query-processing-part-1/) looks really helpful and approachable 
- NoSQL Databases
- cloud stuff
- more Docker, Git

What I want to learn and understand better longer term (at the moment I can't properly grasp that much of it yet):
- Database Internals - Book by Alex Petrov
- Designing Data-Intensive Applications - Book by Martin Kleppmann
- [Fundamentals of Database Engineering](https://www.udemy.com/course/database-engines-crash-course/) - Course by Hussein Nasser



âš¡ Fun:

I'm a bit obsessed with books and library catalogues. From classics, modernist literature, Science Fiction, popular science, psychology, sociology, memoir, selfhelp to literery fiction and contemporary poetry.

Some of my favorite Authors are Anne Carson, Maggie Nelson, Tommy Pico, Monika Helfer, Sheila Heti, Alejandro Zambra, Simone de Beauvoir, George Eliot, Clarice Lispector, Gertrude Stein, Virginia Woolf, Ted Chiang, Carlo Rovelli, Peter Levine.
